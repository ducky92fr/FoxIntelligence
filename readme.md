Running test

- To run the test, you need to put the htlm file into html folder and give it a name.
- Then make sure the argument when passing into "scrapeMachine.startScrape(name_of_html_file)" must match the html name.
- For example if you have fox.html. You should pass "fox" into parameter.
- Json file will be generated into json folder with the same name of html file.
